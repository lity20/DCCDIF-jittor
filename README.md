# DCCDIF-jittor

This is an implementation of the CVPR 2022 paper [Learning Deep Implicit Functions for 3D Shapes with Dynamic Code Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14048).

**Implemented by [Jittor](https://cg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/jittor/).**

## Data

We use the [ShapeNet](https://shapenet.org/) dataset in our experiments. To run our method, the sampled points and their signed distances are needed as training data. We put the code and documents about data processing in [`sample_SDF_points.zip`](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UIh8AxULPi9vY0c1wuZ7HRX4XxDI6a1P). For ease of use, we also provide the processed data of `bench` in [`02828884_sdf_samples.zip`](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UIh8AxULPi9vY0c1wuZ7HRX4XxDI6a1P). 

## Running code

First, install python denpendencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, prepare your configuration file based on the example we provide in `configs/bench.py`. You may need to specify the paths to data and split files.


Now you can reproduce the experimental results in our paper by running:
```
python train.py configs.bench
python reconstruct.py configs.bench
python evaluate.py configs.bench
```
